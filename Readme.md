# 🕯️ Shabbat Hayom

**Shabbat Hayom** is a fast-paced action-puzzle game developed in one week as part of the Game Lab course at Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design.

You play as a last-minute shopper racing through a chaotic Jerusalem supermarket on Friday afternoon. The clock is ticking, the intercom is screaming, and your cart is your only hope to beat the pre-Shabbat rush.

## 👨‍💻 My Role

As the lead gameplay developer, I was responsible for:

- Designing and implementing the **Tetris-style core mechanic**, including:
  - Item spawning and falling logic
  - Collision detection and item stacking
  - Shopping cart grid system and validation
- Coding the **player controls** and movement
- Developing the **overall game loop** (timer, end conditions, intercom messages)
- **Managing the Git repository** and coordinating collaboration between developers and designers
- Supporting integration of UI elements and animations

This project gave me a chance to combine fast prototyping with system design, under a tight one-week schedule.

## ✡️ Why "Shabbat Hayom"?

In Jerusalem, the Friday atmosphere is like no other. Shops are packed, clocks are ticking, and that final hour before Shabbat begins is a race.  
We wanted to capture that unique tension and chaos in a humorous and engaging gameplay experience.
